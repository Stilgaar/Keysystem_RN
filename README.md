## WELCOME TO KEY SYSTEM STUFF

Alright.

First clone it.
Go in the folder cd whatheverfolderyouused
Then make a beautiful npm i in this folder
Then go for a cd android
Go a beautiful "./gradlew clean" (beacause, reasons and)

Then cd ..
Finaly try to launch the app, 'npm run android' (and pray ?)

Sometimes check if your device is there

Some rules : 
- for the hooks i use React.useState or React.useAnyHook. (thats juste a mnemotechnique way to know when im on a web app or native app)
- same goes for functions i export default them at first lines and thats pretty it

The App is sometimes crashing, well not really crashing, it just turns out. I don't know why (yet) Maybe its the continenal part ? IDK. Didnt had the time to check it out.

For the login it's simple email : "stil@stil.ar", password : 0000 (its hardcoded)

Google Maps API : AIzaSyDrCiuEdo1QVqLEthD1oLDlGJy4vD8LIcQ (its jeff's at the moment, dont screw over !) (pliz ?)

If you need to add a font, put it in the assets/Font folder and run a npx react-native-asset
